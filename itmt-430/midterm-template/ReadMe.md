# Midterm Report

## ITMT 430 2019 - Daniel Rybski

### Sprint 1


1. 
In sprint one we had to find a project that we felt a team of three could accomplish without any of us having serious coding experience. One of my IPRO’s was a website that matched consumers with a products they needed that were made in the USA. I thought if we did the Ride Sharing option it would be very similar in the matching structure while using database. So we drew up a rough draft / diagram on the website based on interfaces that made sense to us. We wanted it to be as simple as possible. You click a location on a map and it gives you a list of people that also chose that location. From the first assignment I thought open connect or AWS could be options but it was too complicated and we went with FireBase Instead. For sprint 1 all three of us were charge of coming up with a flow chart depicting the functionality of the website. We then took all three of our designs and came up with one that took the best parts of each others. As shown in the first Trello board accomplishment. Ken put together the final one that is in our sprint one slide show. I then was in charge of coming up with a first draft of the map selection process. I went with the spoke design on a map of the chicago and area. I used a photo editing to roughly put the spokes on and used a screenshot from google maps for the first design. I took major roadways and public transportation into account. Ken and I put then powerpoint together.

1. I created the map design as tasked. I did my part in the overall design of the sprint process. For sprint 1 all three of us were charge of coming up with a flow chart depicting the functionality of the website. We then took all three of our designs and came up with one that took the best parts of each others. As shown in the first Trello board accomplishment.

### Sprint 2

1. I slightly redefined the mapping process to include north and side coordinates in hopes of making the matching process more precise. I also came up with the concept of Travel Buddy rather than just a way to car pool because of how many students take public transportation to campus. This would make it useful to more than just people looking to drive to campus. It would offer a safer / more convenient way to travel for ANY commuter student coming to IIT. I borrowed a map that broke the chicagoland area into regional sections that are easily defined by the user. I have limited experience in graphic design so the spoke making process took a long time to make and to be honest, It wasn’t very pretty but the sections were determined by a more logical 7-10 mile distance. Mileage of sections depended on where you lived on the lap based on major roadways. I didn’t want somebody matching with somebody that would make them get off the expressway to pick them up. That would not make any sense. Ken and I put then powerpoint together for our class presentation. 

1. our spring report going into Sprint 2 was to 
1) Draw out the pseudo code for the system of matching user together.
2) Further map out how the website will work and run.
3) Explore the possibility of using the google api to aid in the user experience.
I could not find a way to get the APi to work with what we were doing. Ken and I got a nice pseudo code put together with Reshma. We put our heads together and all designed a interface and used the best parts of each one to come up with the best possible design. I was not responsible for number two but it fit in with us putting together a logical interface mapping out what we individually thought was best in our own flow charts.

### Sprint 3

1. 
I was tasked with hard coding the sectional pieces of the map and making them clickable. Again, we had to make the  asuserface simple as possible so we completely eliminated the spokes. It was my decision and the team completely supposed it once I explain that the broader we make it, contradicting our previous beliefs of a very precise matching system, we could give the users even more options find a Travel Buddy! I have very limited experience in graphic design and we needed a professional looking map so I spent a lot of time completely re creating the map we were using to make it high resolution. I downloaded a trial version of photoshop and got to work on a professional quality map that would make our site legitimate and professional. I then begun the process for coding the buttons on the map for our website. This was challenging for several reasons. One of them being our website crashed due to human error and I could not access the original website design my teammates got from the web. I had to write the code in a seperate repo that I shared with the team via slack. I had to design the map and implement it as an individual block of code that could be easily added to the site once they got it back up. Getting the buttons the map in their exact locations wasn’t going to be possible since I could not add exact padding to the code without the site being up so I added the locations under the map as a drop down selection that the user would be able to sort through. I was in Florida on a school sponsored trip coaching our school’s men’s baseball team so I was not there for our presentation. It was communicated before hand with my team and professor. 

1. 
Our sprint goals going into our third presentation were to
1)Add new pages to the website ✔
2) create an About Us page
3) deploy a Signup page 
4) Deploy the website to test live service 
5) Attempt to integrate Firebase to project 
6) Code the matching system into the website

Going into the third presentation I did my part by contributing to a few of the sprint goals mentioned above. For 1, we communicated as a team what pages we needed on the site. I did not have a major hands in this but I emphasized keeping it as simple as possible so the website is efficient and direct. 
for 2) I helped define what Travel Buddy was about. I came up with the concept of matching people together that are in the same region so they could do more than just car pool. I communicated the idea of matching people together that could take public transportation together to promote safe travel for those that take advantage of their UPass or take the Metra to campus. 
3) I had no role in this.
4) I coded the map and put together a drop down menu for the website. I could not put it on the team github because it was not running as explained above. I had to do it on my own seperate repo and make it a psuedo code that could be easily added into the websites design once it was deployable again. 
5) I did not have a roll in Firebase.
6)  I coded the map and put together a drop down menu for the website. I could not put it on the team github because it was not running as explained above.
